Do not add your own translations to this directory. They will be lost during plugin
updates. The only .php files that should be loaded from here are pre-made translations
that come with the plugin.

Store your translations at:
wp-content/languages/{$extension}/{$locale}.php
(e.g. wp-content/languages/CarRental/en_US.php) to keep them safe from loss during updates.

Please feel free to submit your translation to us.
